        <p>Caraway is a new charity which is promoting the spiritual well-being of those in their later years in Southampton, both at home, in the community and in care, reaching out to those of all faiths or none, so that each older person continues to be significant and to flourish until the end of their life.</p>

        <p>Working together with local churches, voluntary organisations and statutory bodies, Caraway aims to spiritually resource the older person, in recognition of not only their value and potential, but also the vulnerability and risk of social isolation that has been identified in this demographic. This work will be enabled by a team of community based Anna Chaplains, affiliated with <a href="https://www.thegiftofyears.org.uk/what-anna-chaplain">The Gift of Years</a>, within the city of Southampton and surrounding areas.</p>

        <p>We are currently developing a website, but if you would like more information about this charity then we would love to hear from you. Please contact us at: </p>
